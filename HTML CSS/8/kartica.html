      <h3>Vincent van Gogh Wheat Field with Cypresses</h3>
      <p>
        The painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate
        Provençal cypress towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter
        green olive trees in the middle distance, with hills and mountains
        visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above. The
        first version (F717) was painted in late June or early July 1889, during
        a period of frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed The
        Starry Night, at a time when he was fascinated by the cypress. It is
        likely to have been painted "en plein air", near the subject, when Van
        Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum.
