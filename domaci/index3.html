        <h2>Facts about panda bears</h2>
        <p>
          Pandas have 6 "fingers"! A panda's 6th "finger" is like a human thumb.
          It has the same function as a thumb, but it is actually an unusual
          wrist bone or opposable paw heel with strong muscles but no movable
          joints, which allows it to grasp food. They can press the bamboo into
          fat cigar shapes with their 6th digits for efficient eating. Pandas
          will abandon a child if she has twins. A baby panda with its mother
          Wild pandas usually have just one cub, while pandas in captivity are
          more likely to have twins. In the wild, If the mother panda has two
          cubs, she will only feed the one she thinks is stronger.
