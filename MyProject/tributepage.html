        <h2>
          Malala Yousafzai is the youngest person to receive a Nobel Prize.
        </h2>
        <p>
          While there are many essential Malala Yousafzai facts, one of the most
          notable ones is her status as the youngest Nobel Prize Laureate in
          history. On October 10th, 2014, Malala Yousafzai became co-recipient
          of the Nobel Peace Prize. She received the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize in
          Norway along with children’s rights advocate Kailash Satyarthi. At 17
          years old, Malala became the youngest person to ever receive a Nobel
          Prize, along with being the second Pakistani in history to receive
          one. During Malala’s Nobel Peace Prize awarding ceremony, 21-year-old
          Mexican college student Adán Cortés interrupted the program to protest
          the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping. Security personnel promptly took
          Cortés away. Malala responded to this with sympathy and acknowledged
          that young people worldwide face different problems. She also
          expressed that it’s important for the youth to speak up and protest.

        <h2>Malala spoke out against the Pakistani Taliban at a young age.</h2>
        <p>
          Around 2007, the Pakistani Taliban began to occupy Swat, the district
          wherein Malala’s family resided. Only 10 years old at the time, Malala
          lived with her parents, two younger brothers, and two pet chickens.
          The Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-i-Taliban in Pakistan (TTP), wanted
          to enforce their strict and radical version of the Islamic Sharia law.
          The Pakistani Taliban wanted to impose a number of extreme rules such
          as death penalty for music store owners and barbers. They also
          prevented people from getting vaccinated, listening to music, or
          watching television. Furthermore, they banned girls from schools. The
          extremists also went as far as shutting down and blowing up schools.
          The Pakistani Taliban’s occupation of Swat thus forced Malala
          Yousafzai and her classmates to stop going to school. By the end of
          2008, the Pakistani Taliban destroyed over 400 schools. This
          consequently prompted Yousafzai to speak out about the Taliban at a
          young age. Malala delivered her first public speech in September 2008
          during a press club in Peshawar. Her speech, entitled How dare the
          Taliban take away my basic right to education? quickly caught the
          media’s attention. Yousafzai then became known for her remarkable
          courage by speaking out against the Taliban at 11 years old.

        <h2>Malala Yousafzai worked as a blogger for BBC Urdu.</h2>
        <p>
          In 2008, BBC Urdu wanted to cover the Pakistani Taliban’s occupation
          of Swat through the eyes of a schoolgirl residing in the area. Many
          students refused to write for them because their families were worried
          about the potential risks that this could bring. One of their
          correspondents got in contact with Ziauddin Yousafzai, Malala’s
          father, who was also a local school teacher.Eventually, Ziauddin
          Yousafzai suggested that his daughter, Malala, could write for them.
          The editors at the BBC agreed that Malala Yousafzai could blog about
          the citizens’ daily lives under the regime of the Pakistani Taliban.
          She was in seventh grade at that time. To protect Malala, the BBC
          asked her to write under a pseudonym. Malala then wrote under the
          pseudonym “Gul Makai”, which takes inspiration from a Pashtun folk
          tale character. The BBC published her first entry on January 3, 2009.

        <h2>The Pakistani Taliban shot Malala Yousafzai in the head.</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the dangers, Malala Yousafzai fervently spoke out against the
          Pakistani Taliban. She received death threats through social media and
          even had notes and newspapers slipped under her door. In 2012,
          however, the threats became reality. On October 9th, 2012, a gunman of
          the Pakistani Taliban attacked Yousafzai as she was walking home from
          school with her friends Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan. The two girls
          were stable after the shooting and survived to provide information to
          the authorities. Unfortunately, Malala was left in critical condition.
          The bullet hit her several inches away from her left eye, pierced her
          neck, and lodged in her shoulder. Doctors operated on her in a
          military hospital in Peshawar, and she would later receive further
          treatment in Birmingham, England. She woke up from her coma on October
          17th, 2012 and received medical treatment until her full recovery. The
          hospital discharged her on January 3, 2013. The incident quickly
          gained worldwide news coverage. For many, it evoked feelings of anger
          and sympathy. Various world leaders, such as Pakistan’s Asif Ali
          Zardari, UN’s Ban Ki-moon, and US’s Barack Obama spoke out against the
          incident and the Pakistani Taliban.

        <h2>Malala welcomed her 16th birthday by giving a speech.</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting Malala Yousafzai facts is that on July 12,
          2013, she celebrated her 16th birthday by giving a speech at the
          United Nations headquarters. This was also her first public speech
          following her attack in 2012. During the ceremony, Malala wore one of
          the shawls of the late Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan’s first female prime
          minister. In her speech, she thanked everyone who supported her and
          aided in her recovery and acknowledged that she spoke for thousands of
          people who struggle to voice out their calls of help. Malala Yousafzai
          also spoke about women’s basic human rights, including rights to
          education, which the Pakistani Taliban tried to suppress. She called
          upon governments to provide children with free, compulsory education,
          and sought to ensure a brighter future for children worldwide. The
          Kate Whitney song Speak Out aired on International Women’s Day 2017,
          uses words from the speech as lyrics.

        <h2>The United Nations officially dubbed July 12th as “Malala Day.”</h2>
        <p>
          Malala Yousafzai’s speech caught the attention of many and inspired
          leaders and celebrities worldwide. For many, she became a symbol of
          resistance and a beacon of hope for girls all around the world. To
          honor her bravery, the United Nations dubbed the day of her speech as
          Malala Day. Yousafzai commented on this by saying, “Malala day is not
          my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who
          have raised their voice for their rights.”

      <div class="box7">
        <h2>She co-founded the Malala Fund in 2013.</h2>
        <p>
          In 2013, Malala Yousafzai funded the Malala Fund with her father.
          Based in Birmingham, England, the Malala Fund is a non-profit
          organization committed to providing worldwide access to free, safe,
          and quality education. Interestingly, the first contribution to the
          organization came from renowned actress Angelina Jolie. She donated
          $200,000 to fund the education of girls from the Swat District, where
          Malala came from. The Malala Fund went on to finance the creation of
          schools, classrooms, and educational programs for girls in many
          different countries, such as India, Brazil, Kenya, Ethiopia, Pakistan,
          and Turkey, among others.

        <h2>She is the youngest UN Messenger of Peace.</h2>
        <p>
          In 2017, Malala received the highest honor given by the United Nations
          to citizens. They designated her a UN Messenger of Peace because of
          her resolve to create a better world. As Messenger of Peace, she
          continues to speak out about education for all and equal basic human
          rights. Additionally, she states that education is a right for all and
          should not be neglected. Other notable UN Messengers of Peace are Jane
          Goodall, Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, and Stevie Wonder. Truly
          one of the most outstanding Malala Yousafzai facts.

        <h2>Malala Yousafzai takes inspiration from her father.</h2>
        <p>
          Malala Yousafzai’s upbringing helped shape her unwavering advocacies.
          Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, is a teacher and a social activist
          himself. He founded a school in their region, advocating for equal
          educational rights for both boys and girls. As a child, he faced
          bullying for his skin color, socioeconomic status, and his stuttering
          problems. He also gained awareness of their society’s discrimination
          against women, and he vowed to advocate against all kinds of
          discrimination and injustice. Ziauddin Yousafzai’s work inspired
          Malala to take action as well. He had a profound influence on the
          young girl and encouraged her to become a politician in the future.
          Ziauddin described his daughter Malala as a bright and special girl
          who would often discuss politics with him.

          One of the more recent Malala Yousafzai facts is that she graduated
          from Oxford University. In 2017, she started studying in Oxford
          University. She studied at one of Oxford’s colleges, Lady Margaret
          Hall. Benazir Bhutto also studied in this college in the 1970s. During
          her time in Oxford, Malala stated that she joined the Oxford Union,
          the Oxford Pakistan Society, and the cricket club. She also lived a
          relatively normal college life and stated that she often crammed
